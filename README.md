# File Compression Using Huffman Coding

This project implements a file compression algorithm using Huffman coding, a lossless data compression technique. 


## Features
- Implements Huffman coding for file compression.
- Demonstrates efficient memory management.
- Includes example files for testing compression and decompression.

## Acknowledgments
- Huffman coding explanation from [GeeksforGeeks] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/huffman-coding-greedy-algo-3/).


This repository was originally, created using C as a summer project. Due to school commitments, the C implementation was left incomplete. Recently, I revisited this project to improve upon it using C++. The C++ implementation introduces cleaner code, better abstractions, and improved maintainability. Both the incomplete C and C++ versions are preserved here to showcase the evolution of my skills and my approach to completing and refining the project.
